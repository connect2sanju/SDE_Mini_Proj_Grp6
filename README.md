# Hybrid Retrieval System

## Overview

This project implements a hybrid retrieval system that leverages both traditional keyword-based search and modern vector-based search approaches. The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, combining BM25 keyword retrieval, FAISS vector similarity retrieval, and an ensemble method to provide accurate search results.

The system includes different architectural patterns for organizing search functionalities:

- **Layered Pattern**
- **Client-Server Pattern**
